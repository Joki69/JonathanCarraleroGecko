"Fool","Arsène","Arsène Lupin, sometimes known as Raoul, is a fictional gentleman thief created by Maurice Leblanc. He was known for targeting criminals or those who were much worse than himself, making him an anti-hero of sorts within his own stories. He might have been partly inspired by the French anarchist Marius Jacob."
"Fool","Obariyon","The Obariyon is a Japanese ""piggyback demon"" from local folklore. While a person is walking along a woodland or grassy path, the obariyon may jump out and attach itself to their back. While it cannot be seen, its weight can be felt by the person, and it becomes harder to walk. The obariyon cannot be easily removed without the use of magic, but it is said if you can remove it and take it home, it will turn into many valuable gold coins."
"Fool","High Pixie","High Pixies are high ranking pixies that act as leaders or commanders of younger pixies. Generally, a charismatic pixie can obtain this rank from proving its skill and loyalty. They watch over the younger pixies as guardians, and ensure they are kept out of danger, although they are every bit as mischievous as their younger counterparts. They are charged with guarding the ruins and caves where other pixies dwell."
